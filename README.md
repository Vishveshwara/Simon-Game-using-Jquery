# Simon-Game-using-Jquery
The Simon game is a classic memory game where players have to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. This game uses jQuery, a popular JavaScript library, to create an interactive web application.

The game starts by randomly selecting a color and adding it to the sequence. The player must then click on the corresponding button to repeat the sequence. If the player successfully repeats the sequence, another color is added to the sequence and the player must repeat the longer sequence. However, if the player makes a mistake, the game is over and they must start again from the beginning.

To make the game more interesting, the speed of the sequence increases as the player progresses through the levels. Additionally, there are sound effects and visual feedback to indicate whether the player has made a correct or incorrect move.

Overall, the Simon game is a fun and challenging way to test your memory and reaction time. With jQuery, it's easy to build a dynamic and engaging version of this classic game on the web.
